Data Visualization Project

Overview

The Data Visualization Project provides an in-depth analysis of a dataset containing information on various movie metrics, such as production costs, revenue, ratings, and genres. The purpose of this project is to deliver interactive and insightful visualizations that allow users to explore and interpret industry trends and financial aspects of top 500 movies. By leveraging modern data visualization tools and techniques, this project aims to present data in a clear and engaging manner, facilitating informed decision-making and deeper understanding of the movie industry.

JavaScript Implementation
1. Dynamic Image Toggling

JavaScript is used to switch between different images based on user selection from a dropdown menu. This functionality is implemented using the change event listener on the dropdown element. The JavaScript code hides all images initially and only displays the image corresponding to the selected dropdown value.

2. Interactive Data Visualizations

The project uses Plotly.js, a powerful JavaScript library, to create interactive visualizations. Plotly charts are embedded in the HTML file and configured to update based on user inputs or interactions.
3. User-Driven Interaction

The website includes interactive elements such as dropdown menus to select different types of plots. This allows users to view various data visualizations without needing to reload the page.

Website Structure
1. HTML

The HTML file (index.html) sets up the structure of the webpage, including headers, dropdown menus, and placeholders for visualizations.
2. CSS

The CSS file (styles.css) styles the webpage elements and ensures that images are hidden or shown as needed. It also includes basic styling for layout and appearance.
3. JavaScript Files

script.js: Handles image toggling based on dropdown selection.
visualizations.js: Manages Plotly chart creation and updates.
Summary
The website leverages JavaScript for dynamic image display and interactive data visualizations. By combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project creates a user-friendly interface for exploring movie data through various visualizations. The use of external libraries like Plotly enhances the interactivity and presentation of data.
